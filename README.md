### Business Understanding

Black Friday is the 'official' kick off to the holiday shopping season, the most important shopping period. It's important for the sellers to look into the history sales data and prepare early for the next shopping season so as not to lose the grain.

I'm going to perform some exploration on Black Friday Dataset From Kaggle. The task or questions I will target for as below:

Understanding these questions may provide some advice for the sellers to better understand the customer purchase behaviour against different products so that the seller can prepare for the next shopping season well.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Black Friday Dataset from Kaggle to better understand:

Question 1: Which gender spent most during black Friday?
Question 2:how much each gender spent in regards to eachself? What Type of Product each gender buys mostly?
Question 3: Which age group spent most during black Friday?
Question 4: Which products are most popular during Black Friday?

Question 6: Correlation between Gender, Age, Occupation, City_Category, Stay_In_Current_City_Years, Marital_Status, Product_Category_x vs Purchase

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

BlackFriday.csv       - This file contains 550,000 observations about the black Friday in a retail store, it contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical. It contains missing values.
